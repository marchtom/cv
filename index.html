                            In this new phase, I've continued to thrive as a Lead Developer and Software Engineer, delivering impactful projects, taking ownership of crucial components. Notably, I was involved in the creation of the Medication Lookup, utilizing Azure's Cognitive Search to build a fast and reliable search engine for approved medications. I played a significant role in the Notifications Rule Engine project, orchestrating notification campaigns. The most recent project, Cohort Builder, demanded a flexible solution independent of DevOps or Database Admins support. This was achieved by employing a dedicated Python service responsible for aggregating and storing data in MongoDB, with a GraphQL API exposing MongoDB data to meet our project requirements.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            Before joining IQVIA, I worked as a developer at Indoorway. My early tasks involved on-demand spatial data analysis and the creation of tools dedicated to performing specialized work. As the company underwent structural changes, my focus shifted to backend-oriented tasks. I took charge of overseeing the Ruby on Rails GraphQL backend and played a pivotal role in building a robust Python GraphQL infrastructure, starting from the MVP version to a fully functional product.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            Beyond the professional landscape, my academic journey includes a PhD in Experimental Nuclear Physics. During my time at the Heavy Ion Laboratory, I engaged in researching the internal structure of the nucleus. Programming and data analysis became integral to my work, as I navigated through well-known tools within the scientific community and developed proficiency in reading and analyzing code.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            In my free time, I'm an avid board game collector with around 90 game boxes. I have a particular fondness for euro-economic games but also enjoy the lighter titles for a more relaxed and enjoyable experience. I find the strategic depth of these games to be a delightful contrast to the unpredictability of luck in lighter titles.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            Moreover, I've recently discovered a passion for cooking, finding parallels between the culinary world and coding techniques. Crafting self-made meals has become a creative outlet, allowing me to experiment with various flavors and cooking styles. Similar to cooking, I've delved into brewing kombucha as another hands-on hobby. This relatively recent discovery has led me to experiment with different types and flavors of kombucha, adding an exciting dimension to my leisure time.

Tasked with maintaining and calibrating experimental equipment, notably the EAGLE device (<a href="https://www.slcj.uw.edu.pl/en/eagle/">link here</a>), I found solace in hands-on work away from the computer. Additionally, I embraced the role of teaching students, serving as a tutor and supervisor for those participating in intensive research workshops aligned with my laboratory's activities.

                                    <h4>Board games</h4>
                                    I love board games, and it's not just about playing them - I'm also a collector. Right now, I've got around 90 game boxes in my collection, and I'm really into euro-economic games. But I also enjoy throwing some lighter games on the table just to kick back, relax, and have a good laugh over the twists and turns of luck.

                                    <h4>Video games</h4>
                                    My easily accessible hobby. I mainly play MMORPG genre games because I enjoy the social interactions along with the feeling of progression through game mechanics. I don't shy away from playing strategy or even life simulator games.

                                    <h4>Sci-fi and fantasy books</h4>
                                    In addition to sci-fi and fantasy books, I also delve into popular science books covering various topics (Oliver Sacks' "The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat" remains one of my all-time favorites). When it comes to sci-fi and fantasy, I seek out books with intricately crafted worlds. This is why Jacek Dukaj and Tomasz Kołodziejczak rank among my favorite Polish authors. Additionally, Sir Terry Pratchett holds the title of my favorite non-Polish writer.

                                    <h4>Cooking</h4>
                                    A relatively recent discovery, but I've developed a genuine liking for cooking. Given my discerning tastes, I find that self-made meals suit me best. The revelation that cooking shares many similarities with coding, and the fact that various techniques can be mastered on multiple levels, got me completely hooked. Similar to cooking, as it involves crafting something with my own hands, I've taken up brewing kombucha. I discovered this hobby a few months ago, and since then, I've been brewing various types of kombucha, experimenting with different flavors and styles.
